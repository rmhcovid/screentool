# RMH Covid-19 REDCap Screentool

**\*\*This tool is being updated daily as information and recommendations regarding the virus develop. Please check back regularly for updates.\*\***


Screentool is a website for rapidly screening patients when they present at a medical facility and may have contracted the Covid-19 virus. It is a [REDCap](https://projectredcap.org/software/) (Research Electronic Data Capture tool) project that can be copied, and adapted for your medical facility.

Patients use the website to enter their own symptoms, contact information, and travel history. Using the latest available government information they are separated into risk categories. Staff are notified of possible cases, and the patient is given actionable information (on screen, by email and SMS).

Screentool requests and assesses the patient's:

- Virus symptoms (& dates)
- Contact with known Covid-19 cases (& dates)
- Recent international travel history
- Covid-19 testing history
- Name, dob and contact information
- Allergy information
- Reason for presenting and personal assessment of risk

**As of March 2020** it is in use at the Royal Melbourne Hospital in Victoria, Australia, and a number of other hospitals around the world.
